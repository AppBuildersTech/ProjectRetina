## **Diabetic Retinopathy Detection**

This folder contains the term project of BM59D "Machine Learning" course offered by Assist Prof. İpek Şen at Biomedical Engineering Department, Boğaziçi University in 2017 Fall Term.

The project is inspired by past Kaggle Competition [Diabetic Retinopathy Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection).

### *DATASET*

The dataset can be found in competition [page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data).

### *MODULES*

To implement the methodology Python 3.5.2 is used. Below you can see the necessary modules and their versions that were used in generating and testing this code:
